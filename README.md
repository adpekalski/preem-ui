 React animated components library

### STACK
- `React`  
- `Typescript`  
- `Vite`  
- `Storybook`  
- `Styled components` - uncertain  
  - At first wanted to opt for `pandaCSS` because of zero runtime and because of the fact that basic CSS-in-JS libraries can cause performance issues. In the end I picked `styled Components` because of better documentation and because it's more estabilished. Would need to think about wheter to choose staying with CSS-in-JS or going for something like `Sass`.
